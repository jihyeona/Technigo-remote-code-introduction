  <h1>WHAT IS MOB PROGRAMMING?</h1>

  <h2>
    <p>Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This extends the concept of pair programming from two people working together to the entire team continuously collaborating at a single computer to deliver a single work item at a time.</p>
